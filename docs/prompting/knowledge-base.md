# ShopLite Knowledge Base (RAG Corpus)

## Doc 01: User Registration & Accounts
ShopLite offers both buyer and seller accounts, giving flexibility for customers who only wish to shop and for businesses that want to sell. Buyers register by providing an email, a password, and optional phone number. Email verification is required within 24 hours to activate the account. Passwords must meet strong requirements: at least twelve characters, one number, and one symbol. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) via authenticator apps is supported to reduce account takeover risks.
Sellers begin with a buyer account and then upgrade. This process requires submitting business details such as tax ID, return address, and payout bank information. Verification is normally completed in 2–3 business days. Once approved, sellers access the Seller Dashboard where they can list products, manage orders, and monitor payouts. Users can reset their password through secure email links. Accounts are locked after multiple failed attempts, but unlock automatically after 15 minutes or with a password reset. Account deletion requests permanently erase personal data within 30 days, except for legally required records like invoices and completed orders. Export of personal data is available before deletion for transparency.

## Doc 02: Product Search & Filters
ShopLite’s search system is designed to help customers find products quickly and accurately. Users can search by keyword or apply structured filters such as category, brand, price range, average rating, and availability. Typeahead suggestions surface up to five SKUs, with a preference for items in stock. These suggestions are refreshed hourly through cached results, ensuring speed while maintaining accuracy.
Natural language queries such as “under $50” or “4-star and up” are automatically translated into structured filters. Sorting options allow customers to view results by relevance (default), lowest price, highest price, rating, or newest arrivals. Misspellings are corrected when confidence exceeds a threshold of 0.8, minimizing frustration for customers. Restricted or adult items never appear in general search results, regardless of filters. Additional safety checks prevent harmful or inappropriate queries from returning results. The search pipeline prioritizes relevance while balancing performance, with p95 latency goals kept under 300ms. By combining structured filtering, semantic understanding, and fast caching, ShopLite’s search ensures users can easily find what they are looking for.

## Doc 03: Semantic Search & Relevance
Beyond simple keyword search, ShopLite employs semantic embeddings to provide more intelligent results. This means queries such as “cheap running shoes” will retrieve items related to athletic footwear, even if the exact phrase does not match. All retrieved results must correspond to valid in-catalog SKUs; validators prevent any off-catalog hallucinations.
A reranking step evaluates candidate results, scoring them based on overlap with product titles, attributes, and historical click-through data. Items most relevant to the user’s intent are surfaced at the top. This ensures not only semantic accuracy but also alignment with real customer preferences.Caching plays a large role in performance. Around 70% of frequent queries are cached, with refresh cycles set to maintain accuracy. P95 latency for typeahead is targeted at under 300ms, making suggestions feel instantaneous.If queries contain banned or inappropriate terms, the system responds with a safe refusal message and alternative category links. By blending embeddings, rerankers, and guardrails, ShopLite ensures search remains useful, relevant, and aligned with customer expectations while minimizing integration risks

## Doc 06: Order Tracking & Delivery
Once an order is placed, ShopLite assigns a unique order ID and provides a tracking link. Customers can follow the shipment status directly from their account dashboard or email confirmations. Common status updates include “Processing,” “Shipped,” “Out for delivery,” and “Delivered.” Standard delivery typically ranges between 3–7 business days. Expedited shipping options are available depending on the carrier and destination. Shipping costs and estimated arrival dates are calculated during checkout so customers can make informed choices.Customers can request an address change only before the order has been marked as “Shipped.” After that point, changes require carrier intervention and may delay delivery. If a delivery issue occurs, customers can initiate a support ticket. ShopLite coordinates with carriers to investigate lost, delayed, or damaged packages.Delivery reliability is tracked across carriers to improve service quality. Notifications are sent by email or mobile app whenever status changes occur. With clear tracking and responsive support, ShopLite ensures customers remain confident about their order’s journey.

## Doc 07: Returns & Refunds
ShopLite offers a straightforward 30-day return policy, beginning from the date of delivery. Items must be unused and returned in their original packaging unless defective. Categories such as perishable goods, personalized items, or digital downloads are non-returnable, and these exceptions are clearly labeled on product pages. Customers initiate returns from the Order Details page, where they can request a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA). A prepaid shipping label may be provided depending on the seller’s policy. Once the return is received and inspected, refunds are issued within 5–10 business days to the original payment method. If products arrive damaged or defective, customers may request replacements instead of refunds. Refunds include the product cost and applicable taxes, but shipping fees may be excluded unless the return is due to seller error. ShopLite’s system keeps customers informed with return status updates by email and dashboard notifications. This clear and consistent approach to returns builds trust and reduces support overhead, ensuring customers feel secure in their purchases.
